## Help the project out

The project needs help and YOU can help it. There's a tutorial on the wiki on how you can fork the project and help it out. Below there's a list of stuff to help us out with.

### Interactive Quizzes

Yes I know Google Forms exist and I want to use that but instead of a link redirecting you to Google Forms, I want somebody to help script a button that opens a popup with an iframe to complete the quiz. I would also like a similar thing with resources for the tutorials we host. #2 (issue)
