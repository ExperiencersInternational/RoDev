<p style="font-family: Inter;">RoDev is a free online opensource learning platform for anybody to use. With working tutorials that often contain an interactive powerpoint/video, RoDev is the learning platform for you. Made by Flynn Farrow (GamersInternational). Project inspired by <a href="https://web.roblox.com/games/1334669864/Lua-Learning">Lua Learning.</a> The project is also being coded by hand for now however I hope to keep the quality a very high quality still. Pages may not be optimised for mobile, I don't generally know how to develop well enough to make it work great on both desktop and mobile (it's working fine on both at the time of writing).</p>
